# Predict deliverables

Predict deliverable is our team folder we decided to add onto the template repo. Its meant to store extra files such as our research notebook and provided data files as well as additional data files. As you might imagine the dataset we where working on was BIG. As such several operations in the notebooks/s may take sometime to run. If you do not wish to wait for long periods of time, do not worry. In the data folder, we have a subfolder named pickles. In there we have multiple pickle files o model objects as well as output files form such operations as hyper-parameter tuning. Additionally the code in the notebook is written such that you can load up thiese pickles rather having to rerun the code. We just thought it would be convenient for the reader. Notece, also that we have two notebook files, one if for the main submission while the other contains an experiment we ran using PySpark, a big data framework. You may view this notebook if you are interested. Please enjoy reading our project files. We hope you like them Thank you for the support.
